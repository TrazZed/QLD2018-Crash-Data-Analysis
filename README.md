# Analysis of Crash Data in Queensland, Australia 2018
This repo presents an analysis of crash data with a focus on identifying key relationships between crash severity and variables such as speed limits, crash types, time of occurrence, and geographic location. The findings indicate that crashes in higher-speed zones tend to result in more severe outcomes, with fatality rates significantly increasing at speeds above 80 km/h. Single-vehicle and pedestrian crashes were observed to have the highest fatality rates, highlighting the need for targeted safety measures. A seasonal trend analysis suggested a possible anomaly in Aprilâ€™s data, warranting further investigation into data integrity. Additionally, geographic analysis revealed that high-crash suburbs, particularly Southport and Brisbane City, are likely influenced by traffic density, road infrastructure, and urban design. These insights provide valuable guidance for road safety interventions and urban planning improvements.
